# Introduction

This workbook contains all the required material for the module NSCI0036.

## How to Interact with the Material

Before starting work you need to set up your Cocalc account by following the instructions in the section [Before You Begin](before-you-begin).

For the first five weeks you will be working through the material in the 'Programming with Python' section. Each week there are three activities to complete plus optional further practice exercises.

### 1. Notes

Work through the notes and complete the embedded exercises. Solutions are provided for you to check your understanding.

You must do this **before** attending the workshop.

### 2. Workshop

The workshops lead you through some practical exercises in scientific computing. Work on these during your timetabled practical classes.

### 3. Homework

Complete the homework exercise after class and receive feedback the following week.

### 4. Further Practice (Optional)

## Collaboration

You are encouraged to work on the Workshops and Homeworks in pairs. Effective collaboration is a key learning outcome for this module, so do experiment with Cocalc's collaboration features.
