# Next Steps in Programming

## Tools

Up to now you have been using Cocalc and Jupyter Notebooks to do your programming. A recommended next step is to download a Python distrbution such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) do that you can develop and run Python programs directly on your computer.

## Useful Resources

The available resources for studying Python are constantly changing, and so this list is likely to become quickly out of date. If you find a particularly useful resource, please [get in touch](mailto:p.bratby@ucl.ac.uk) and I will add it to the list.

### LinkedIn Learning

As a current UCL student you have access to [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/linkedin-learning), which includes a range of video tutorials and structured courses in programming with Python.

### Textbooks

There are a number of textbooks available from the library. For example, this physical book [Python Basics: a Practical Introduction to Python 3](https://ucl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44UCL_INST/155jbua/alma9932054773404761) or [Python Fundamentals: A practical guide for learning Python, complete with real-world projects for you to explore](https://ucl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44UCL_INST/18kagqf/cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9781789809947) which is available online.


### Online resources

Two useful web sites are [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) and [Dive Into Python](https://diveintopython.org/) (with its associated [online textbook](https://book.diveintopython.org/)).
