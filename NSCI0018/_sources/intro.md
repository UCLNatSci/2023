# Introduction

In this module you will apply the mathematical language of differential equations and vector calculus to study understand phenomena in ocillations and harmonic motion, wave theory and fluid dynamics. We will follow two units through the module:

1. Waves
	1. An introduction to oscillations and harmonic motion
	2. Derivation of the wave equation
	3. Solving the wave equation, d'Alembert wave solution and separable ansatz
	4. Dispersion relations and wave speeds
	5. Wave energy and wave power
	6. Standing waves
	7. Matter waves and the Schr√∂dinger equation
	8. Doppler shift
	9. Huygen's principle and diffraction

3. Fluid Dynamics
	1. Introduction to fluid mechanics
	2. Conservation of mass, energy and momentum
	3. Euler solutions and Benulli's equation
	4. Concepts of vorticity and rotational/irrotational flow
	5. Deduce special forms of the NS equations, such as for incompressible, adiabatic flow, steady flow
	6. Investigate classic fluid phenomena, such as surface waves in deep/shallow water
