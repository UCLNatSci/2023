# Friedmann Equation Methods

Solving the Friedmann equations is in general *hard* because the equation contains a non-linear ODE term.  However by simplifying the system a little (and tracking your assumptions), finding some solutions with analytical methods is straightforward.

A firs assumption is to make the pressure $P$ here zero, $P= 0$, this simplifies the system to:

\dot{\rho} =
