# Introduction

The study of quantum mechanics over the past century has lead physicists to some of their most detailed pictures of nature as well as some of the most convicing matches between prediction and observatinon.  However one area that has remained stubbornly without a clear resolution is the area of **Quantum Foundations**. 

In this module, we will discuss some of the more intriguing, philosophical and currently unanswerable questions in quantum theory.
